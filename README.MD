SCDF Coding Challenge

Problem Statement Chosen: INTEGRATING WITH A SMART ENVIRONMENT

Solution: Integrating IOT with "myResponder" SCDF App


Modules required:
1) Grove â€“ Vibration Sensor (SW-420)
2) MQ-2 Gas Sensor Smoke Detection Module Sensor ICSG017A
3) SP32

Vibration Sensor:
Non-directional
High sensitivity (adjustable)
Respond to vibration, tilt
When movement or vibration occurs, the circuit will be briefly disconnected and output low
Waterproof
Compression resistance
All in all, this vibration sensor module is perfect in helping you get started with vibration or tilt sensing.

Smoke Detection Sensor:
Application:
For harmful gas family, environment detection device, is suitable for the detection of the ammonia, aromatic compounds, sulfide, benzene vapor, smoke and other harmful gas, gas
sensitive element concentration range: 10 to 1000ppm provides reference cases.
